This is a simple calculator project that gives the user the option to choose between a command-line or graphic interface. The calculator allows for basic operations (addition, subtraction, division, exponents, floor division, etc) and quality of life improvements to the GUI such as backspace, decimal point, and restart. The GUI was made using the tkinter module.
